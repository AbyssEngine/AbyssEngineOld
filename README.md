We only support users who are using an official and legally owned copy of the original game. If you do not
have a copy of the game and/or do not use a Windows computer, it is recommended that you purchase the Windows edition of
the [Diablo 2](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-ii) and [LOD Expansion](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/diablo-ii-lord-of-destruction)
from the Blizzard store directly, and install/patch it on another machine, or in a virtual machine in order to obtain the MPQ files.

MPQs/disks downloaded from unofficial sources are not supported - please do not waste developer time on reporting issues involving mods/hacks or illegal
obtained MPQs.
