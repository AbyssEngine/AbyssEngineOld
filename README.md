AbyssEngine is a game engine designed to run games similar to 2000's style ARPGs such as Diablo II.

This repository provides the core
engine [AbyssEngine Engine](https://github.com/AbyssEngine/AbyssEngine/tree/main/abyssengine), as well as
the [AbyssEngine Toolset (abt)](https://github.com/AbyssEngine/AbyssEngine/tree/main/abysstoolset). It also includes the
library [libAbyss](https://github.com/AbyssEngine/AbyssEngine/tree/main/libabyss), which is used by this project, and
can be used by 3rd party applications as well.
